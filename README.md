# Stranger Things Fan Wiki

An unofficial, fan-made wiki dedicated to the television series *Stranger Things*, developed as a group laboratory activity for a web development course.

## Overview

The website presents eight characters of the series through a home page overview. Each character is shown as a picture card that links to a dedicated profile page. Four additional pages, reachable through buttons and the navigation bar, provide a summary of the story, notable locations, a glossary and a trivia quiz.

## Featured characters

Eleven, Jim Hopper, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, Will Byers, Max Mayfield, Steve Harrington and Joyce Byers.

## Features

- Home page overview with a picture card for every character and a live search filter
- Individual character profiles containing a biography, personality traits, relationships, a quick facts panel and a spoiler note
- Previous and next navigation between character profiles
- Additional pages: The Story So Far, Places in Hawkins, Glossary and a six-question Trivia Quiz
- Upside Down mode, a theme switch that is remembered across pages
- Responsive layout, keyboard navigation support and reduced motion support

## Technologies
